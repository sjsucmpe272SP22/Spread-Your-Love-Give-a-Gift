#Title: "Spread your love-Give a Gift "

##Abstract:  
Our project proposal is to build an online gift delivery system. The system will serve as an online portal for people to browse through, order and ship gifts. The system would include Admin (who hold inventory), buyers (or customers). The system will catalog and categorize the different gifts supplied by Admin and provide customers the opportunity to order(and maybe customize) gifts online. Customers can pay for it online and choose to ship the products to desired addresses. This website will bring all the gift items wrapped and delivered at your doorstep. All you need to do is just grab the gift and go to the party without being indulged in hassle of leaving your place, reach to the required shop, get the item, get it wrapped and then go to the party. 

##Problem Statement:
There are very few chances for us to express our love towards dear ones. Presenting a gift is a way to show special feelings towards our loved pals. There are some features on the different websites for gift options but they deliver it in an improper way including all the bills, MRP on product. So there are a lot of issues with this. Picking on the busy days and picking out a right gift requires a lot of energy, thoughtfulness, and yes, cash. So, In this application, we help the users to find and deliver gifts for any occasion with ease process by making them already customized gifts.

##Technologies used :
Front-end : ReactJS
Back- end : NodeJS
DB : MongoDB

##Persona :
Admin: The administrators are super users where they can add products details, categories etc.
